# Welcome to Andromeda!

## GitHub Branches
Below are a list of branches and documentation.

### Canary `canary`
Ideal for highly technical users. Preview the latest script changes early in the development cycle. These updates are released with limited documentation, without extensive validation and can be unstable.

### Dev `dev`
Ideal for enthusiasts. Access the latest Andromeda preview versions as we incubate new ideas and develop long lead features. There will be some rough edges and low stability.

### Beta `beta`
Ideal for early adopters. These Andromeda versions will be more reliable than builds from the Dev Branch, with updates validated by us. Your feedback has the greatest impact.

### Release Preview `release-preview`
Ideal if you want to preview fixes and certain key features, plus get optional access to the next version of Andromeda before it's generally available to other script developers. This branch is also recommended for main developers.

### Stable `stable`
Ideal if you want perfect features, with no rough edges. This branch is least likely to have bugs, and will be updated slowly to make sure everything works as intended.
